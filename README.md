# Loggerz_py

This is a logger utility that I use throughout my projects.

**ðŸ’¡ ATTENTION:**  
This project is at its first version and it has been written in a rush, so do not expect good quality code for now.

## Getting started

To run the example use:

```bash
python ./main.py
```

To create the distribution package use:

```bash
make dist
```
